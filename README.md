# simple-google-dash-app

It's a dashboard that pulls and then graphs data from a Google sheet. The data is the current rating of a tv show, how many people have rated the show, and the date the rating was pulled.

The function used to update the Google sheet is also included in this repo - it scrapes the website the ranking is on and pushes it to the Google sheet.
