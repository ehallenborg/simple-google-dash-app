# simple-google-dash-app

It's a dashboard that pulls and then graphs data from a Google sheet. The data is the current rating of a tv show, how many people have rated the show, and the date the rating was pulled.

The function used to update the Google sheet is also included in this repo - it scraped the website the ranking is on and pushed it to the Google sheet. It was ran on the Google Cloud using the Cloud Scheduler but was turned off on 4/23/2021.
